=== PCA INTERPRETATION REPORT ===

1. VARIANCE EXPLAINED
-----------------------
PC1 explains 62.36% of variance
PC2 explains 30.97% of variance
PC3 explains 6.49% of variance
PC4 explains 0.14% of variance
PC5 explains 0.06% of variance

Interpretation: The first two components explain most of the variance, suggesting the data can be well-represented in 2D.

2. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS
-----------------------

PC1 (62.36% variance):
  Positive correlations:
  - rsi: 0.7466
  - macd_diff: 0.4210
  Negative correlations:
  - adx: -0.5097
  Interpretation: This component contrasts rsi, macd_diff (positive) with adx (negative).

PC2 (30.97% variance):
  Positive correlations:
  - adx: 0.8171
  - macd_diff: 0.5086
  - rsi: 0.2655
  Negative correlations:
  Interpretation: This component primarily represents adx, macd_diff.

PC3 (6.49% variance):
  Positive correlations:
  - macd_diff: 0.7477
  Negative correlations:
  - rsi: -0.6068
  - adx: -0.2692
  Interpretation: This component contrasts macd_diff (positive) with rsi (negative).

3. OUTLIERS
-----------------------
Found 11 outlier dates:
316, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 458, 462, 463, 464

These dates represent unusual market behavior that deviates significantly from typical patterns.
Potential events to investigate on these dates:
- Significant price movements or market events
- News or regulatory announcements
- Changes in trading volume or liquidity
- Technical market events (e.g., flash crashes)

4. POTENTIAL TRADING STRATEGIES
-----------------------
Based on the PCA results, consider the following strategies:

1. rsi-based strategy:
   Track changes in rsi as it's the most significant factor in the data.

2. Anomaly detection strategy:
   Monitor real-time data for patterns similar to the identified outliers,
   which may signal unusual market conditions that present opportunities.

3. Secondary factor strategy:
   Track adx as a secondary indicator to refine entry/exit timing.

5. NEXT STEPS
-----------------------
1. Validate findings with backtest on historical data
2. Consider developing trading signals based on transformed PC values
3. Monitor outlier dates to see if patterns recur
4. Consider if data preprocessing or feature scaling might improve results
